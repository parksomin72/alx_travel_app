# alxtravelapp

## 📌 About the Project

**alxtravelapp** is a real-world Django application built as the foundation for a scalable travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on initializing the project structure, configuring a robust MySQL database, and integrating essential tools such as Swagger for API documentation. The goal is to demonstrate industry-standard best practices in setting up and managing Django-based backend systems.

By the end of this milestone, you'll have a production-ready backend setup suitable for future development and team collaboration.
